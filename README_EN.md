> If there is a problem that other dependencies cannot be compiled, you can try to remove the "^" of all dependencies in `dependencies` in `pubspec.yaml` or change the plug-in version number to any, and try to compile again.
> If there is still an error, execute `flutter clean` in the main directory of the project and run again.
> If the plug-in version does not match, remember to check whether the plug-in flutter version introduced in the `pubspec.yaml` file is compatible with your local Flutter.

Currently being refactored with flutter2.10.4, check the `refactor` branch for specific progress.
The `dim` plugin will be abandoned and the `tencent_im_sdk_plugin` will be connected to solve all
plug-in compatibility issues. After merging the master, it may also be compatible with empty
security and overall code specifications.

# Run Android androidx.core:core problem

##### Error message:

```
Android dependency 'androidx.core:core' has different version for
the compile (1.0.0) and runtime (1.0.2) classpath. You should
manually set the same version via DependencyResolution
```

##### solution

`External Libraries` at the bottom of the project => `Flutter Plugins` => `image_picker-0.6.1+2`
=> `android` => `build.gradle` and there is `androidx.core:core:version` at the bottom.

Directly change to `androidx.core:core:1.0.0`,
![](assets/git/core.png)

```
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
        testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }
    lintOptions {
        disable 'InvalidPackage'
    }
    dependencies {
        implementation 'androidx.core:core:1.0.0'
        implementation 'androidx.annotation:annotation:1.0.0'
    }
}
```

Then change the permission_handler as well.

# About the project has not been updated for too long

Recently, I have been too busy with work, and basically have no time to update. Then, I was working
on other open source projects before, which caused this project to have no substantial progress for
a long time. Sorry everyone, it will enter the maintenance state from now on.

# Future

* In the later stage, the problems encountered in the project and the ideas for solving them will be
  written into a blog for everyone to learn.
* Imitation of WeChat recording audio open source
