# Problems running androidx.core:core

##### Error message:

```
Android dependency 'androidx.core:core' has different version for 
the compile (1.0.0) and runtime (1.0.2) classpath. 
manually set the same version via DependencyResolution
You should set the same version via DependencyResolution.
```

##### Solution

`External Libraries` => `Flutter Plugins` => `image_picker-0.6.1+2` at the bottom of the project
=> `android` => `build.gradle` then at the bottom there is `androidx.core:core:version`.

Change it directly to `androidx.core:core:1.0.0`.
![](assets/git/core.png)

```
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
        testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }
    lintOptions {
        disable 'InvalidPackage'
    }
    dependencies {
        implementation 'androidx.core:core:1.0.0'
        implementation 'androidx.annotation:annotation:1.0.0'
    }
}
```

And then change the permission_handler as well.
